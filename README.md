# About Rewriting Cmdlet Write-Theme ...
With usage of this cmdlet, you will gain the ability to ... produce a stylish series of themed messages
        
Whether for comedic intentions, OR, in the case of just wanting to be a general, all-around, passed-many-a-checkered-flag-for-first-place-at-everything...-in-their-day-without-even-really-trying, type of person..? 

Like Ricky Bobby, in the classic, hit movie, "Talledaga Nights". Like he says, "If you're not first, you're last..."
        
Well... this cmdlet is dedicated to the people that run the show.

The types of high-shelf, category-5-hurricane's-in-their-mind-on-a-daily-basis, for years... clever, engineering-marvel,  master-extraordinaires... some of them might even be war torn veterans who have seen a lot... done a lot. Calculated as many functions, as 
they have had to snap a neck or two... which is why they're the assassin grade programmers that everyone should be worried about. 
        
Whether they are literally or metaphorically that good..? Snapping necks and cashing checks is in their MO.
        
Maybe they have some stories that easily turn the most rock-hearted, brute force, men... into a bunch of weepy little girls...
        
Stories that even though you or anyone else may have heard before? The way they tell this story *never* gets old... Everybody might actually try to walk out of the room as quickly as possible before they go on yet another "Did I ever tell you the story about the time that I ...?"

Because everybody knows, that as soon as this person does this... and hears this aforementioned awesome, story *begin* with that phrase... They know they're in for a 3 day adventure. Where they're just getting paid to stand there and listen to this person's life story... from the reflection pools of Washington DC, to the Louisiana Bayou, or Grand Canyon... perhaps even wading through waist-high-water flash floods from torrential Asian-Monsoons... having to carry your best friend to safety while he's dying...

Maybe Tom Clancy could have a major involvement in the writing of the book, about the series of events based on these people in particular... Maybe there's an instance where Tom Clancy just got up one day after hearing about this story taking place... he just... randomly, out of the blue... said "Hey, I want to write a book about this." 

Perhaps the character for which Tom Clancy successfully envisioned and created as a direct result of observing the most clever bastards out there, a character based on the real person that Tom Clancy thought would be a perfect person to recruit as an acting replacement for Tom Cruise... 
        
He figured, Mr. Cruise is in all 14 Mission Impossible movies...
Sorta has an acting monopoly on good spy operative movies... pretty easy to see how he's '1st pick' material... Losing Goose in Top Gun really drew out the perfect storm for Tom Cruises acting abilities to take root and manifest into the much more mature version of the character that the man has since been able to tap into, on command... 
        
Because... I heard that Tom took it really hard when he lost Goose. Not Tom Clancy, Tom Cruise. I gotta say... I think that losing Goose could traumatize anybody, let alone any hardened warrior/soldier. 

What I've just spent the last few paragraphs describing, is just a preview... of the level I will have to rise to... in order to merely *describe*, the type of person who could fill Tom Cruises shoes *any day of the week*... because while Tom acts like he's a super secret top notch spy..? 

The people that this cmdlet is written for, and dedicated to... are the type of people that *could* call their spy buddies that live down the street, to keep tabs on you anywhere/everywhere..? But they don't. They could also just out of nowhere, take a vacation whenever, wherever, go, see, do... at the drop of a pin... but they don't do that either. Why...?

Because *they're too busy being awesome*. That's why...

So what you're left with, is a description of the type of grade/character of somebody who should have gotten a Nobel Peace Prize by now... But for some, (in my opinion, real dumb) reason... it just so happens to be the case, that it is actually possible to make something that's *too* peaceful to receive a Nobel Pieace Prize... 

So... you get this underground, back-stage version of events, where that person definitely won at least 12 of them by now... you would think it would upset them that they can't go around telling people that they just so happen to have 12 Nobel Peace Prize awards...
        
This is the cmdlet that *hopes*, or even *attempts* to be... one that was specifically tailor made for the limited few people in this world that happen to have a constant category 5 hurricane going on in their mind every day... and yet, they're as peaceful as can be... 

I just don't know how they do it. Being told that you're too peaceful to receive a Nobel Peace Prize? That *should* be enough to drive any awesome bastard out there... into a frenzy. Like, maybe they deserve this damn prize... They earned it fair and square... and yet...? The prize continues to not be given to this legend...
