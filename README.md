# Secure Digits Plus: Fighting Entropy
Hybrid-DSC is a modification for PowerShell that is targeted to easily automate the distribution of a 
Secure Windows Operating System/Network topology with all dependencies/prerequisites deployed, configured, 
and handled appropriately for any given node(s) it generates. It *sort of* works in the same way that a 
quine would..? Where instead of reproducing the source code, it's just reproducing the code necessary to 
allow a child item to be spawned with deployment AND configuration instructions that can be executed, 
expanded to maturity, and then reintegrated back to the original hive cluster. (Similar to Chef, SCCM, etc.)

From PXE, to 'ready for any person/employee to use and have *all* of their data 100% restored *without the 
problems it had* ... within 10 minutes. (You could say 'System Restore Mode' except it'll *always* work...  )

Or, if you suspect that your computer or domain has 'a massive infection that you just found out about...' 
then, you can perform a live audit of all applications, links, registry paths, items, user accounts, forensics, 
etc... on any/all machines in any/all networks in that domain... It's like Azure except, it doesn't get in your 
face all the time. At every corner. When everyone says "Just use Azure or AWS", they forget that a snowball could 
in fact benefit from being a lot faster and weigh an hell of a lot less... or need 0% of the tractor trailers 
necessary to convert $anyamount of data... to a whopping 3-10% of the original data... It's like, being able to 
move an exobyte by designing a program that can fold up every aspect of itself so that it can be self-decompiled 
and take up a lot less space by using 'being good at mathematics' instead of 'making money off of replicating very 
repetitive strings'.

To provide an extension to MDT, and Windows Update, that may inevitably give rise to 'the kernel that can rewrite 
and self correct itself while it is running', AKA, 'You won't ever need to reboot for security updates or kernel 
revisions or any real reason at all (unless maybe your battery died or your power went out... those situations are 
'hardware related', not 'programmers that don't program very well, related' ) because the updates will achieve live 
updating... Think of Google Chromebook, as efficient... and up to date... Except..? It'll actually have some 
*processing power/balls* under the hood as opposed to anything Chromebook, or iOS/MacOS related... AND, it'll be 
able to protect your little DOM or Kernel from being attacked by some idiot... ( AKA, somebody in the government... ) 
From being exploited. Hence, it's why Professionals and Experts that run *any* software *anywhere*, *everywhere*, and 
then some... well when it comes to a real life honest to god, good, working operating system, who do you think everyone
goes to? Google? "Only for searching the internet", that's about as good as a Chromebook gets. When you need a pair of 
nuts to drive your applications though... Who do you think everyone goes to?

Microsoft. Duh. There are a lot of Linux attempts that Kubes still lacks, for instance, "Being written by the best software 
engineers out there..." It's sort of the most desirable thing about Azure and AWS... they happen to be written by the best 
software engineers out there... And their primary product is called "The Operating System that runs circles around any 
browser based operating system... such as Android/ChromeOS, iOS/MacOS..."...

For your information, that thing is called "Microsoft Windows"... and, guess what. It was... written... by the best... software engineers... out there. And what that means is, you can't even build a quantum computer to compete with how top notch this operating system is bruh. No really. Take your little-girl powered Google ChromeOS, and beat it already..."

It's not like Kubes doesn't make it's best attempt in existence, to hold their head high and hope that it could possibly come in '2nd place' it comes to "Being written by the best software engineers out there..." It's just that when someone with a Chromebook shows up, and you happen to do more than just 'Play Pogo' or 'Edit a text document'... Then, a Google Chromebook is simply "ignoring that you have no nutsack whatsoever, and that in order to do anything of significance... you need to be connected to the internet... and logged in... which, guess what. Can't login if you're not connected to the internet. Idiot. Try to use a chromebook when it is not connected to the internet. I guarantee, you will say "I wish I went with a Windows machine instead... WTF is this garbage..."

# Virtual or Physical
This is targeted to be used in live and virtual environments, together, or split, or what have you. It will absorb 
the updates into the images (via slipstreaming), and enable a way to bypass having to use disk cleanup since the 
images will already feature the latest updates and instructions... ( update engine ) whereby bypassing a need to 
use sysprep or unattend.xml file generation.

# Will add more details soon
