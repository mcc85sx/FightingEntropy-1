# Secure Digits Plus: Fighting Entropy
Hybrid-DSC is a modification for PowerShell that is targeted to easily automate the distribution of a 
Secure Windows Operating System/Network topology with all dependencies/prerequisites deployed, configured, 
and handled appropriately for any given node(s) it generates. It *sort of* works in the same way that a 
quine would..? Where instead of reproducing the source code, it's just reproducing the code necessary to 
allow a child item to be spawned with deployment AND configuration instructions that can be executed, 
expanded to maturity, and then reintegrated back to the original hive cluster. (Similar to Chef, SCCM, etc.)

From PXE, to 'ready for any person/employee to use and have *all* of their data 100% restored *without the 
problems it had* ... within 10 minutes. (You could say 'System Restore Mode' except it'll *always* work...  )

Or, if you suspect that your computer or domain has 'a massive infection that you just found out about...' 
then, you can perform a live audit of all applications, links, registry paths, items, user accounts, forensics, 
etc... on any/all machines in any/all networks in that domain... It's like Azure except, it doesn't get in your 
face all the time. At every corner. When everyone says "Just use Azure or AWS", they forget that a snowball could 
in fact benefit from being a lot faster and weigh an hell of a lot less... or need 0% of the tractor trailers 
necessary to convert $anyamount of data... to a whopping 3-10% of the original data... It's like, being able to 
move an exobyte by designing a program that can fold up every aspect of itself so that it can be self-decompiled 
and take up a lot less space by using 'being good at mathematics' instead of 'making money off of replicating very 
repetitive strings'.

To provide an extension to MDT, and Windows Update, that may inevitably give rise to 'the kernel that can rewrite 
and self correct itself while it is running', AKA, 'You won't ever need to reboot for security updates or kernel 
revisions or any real reason whatsoever... because the updates will achieve live updating... Think of Google 
Chromebook, as efficient... and up to date... Except..? With the amount of *processing power/balls* for things 
that don't run in a browser yet.

# Virtual or Physical
This is targeted to be used in live and virtual environments, together, or split, or what have you. It will absorb 
the updates into the images (via slipstreaming), and enable a way to bypass having to use disk cleanup since the 
images will already feature the latest updates and instructions... ( update engine ) whereby bypassing a need to 
use sysprep or unattend.xml file generation.

# Will add more details soon
