# Hybrid, it's just a pretty cool word for 'does both things'

It's about 1,000 ideas all thrown together like a stack of poker chips. Probably sounds like an overwhelming amount of chips. And it is.

But lets think about 'what would be pretty cool'...

Suppose you just had a 2mb file that could configure everything...?

It's possible.

But how many black holes and space-time continuums have to be interrupted before something like that was actually done?

Could be a fair amount of them to be honest. It's already been about 13.7 billion years... and it *still* isn't here yet.

Or is it...?

It's still not here yet.
But it *will* be pretty soon.
